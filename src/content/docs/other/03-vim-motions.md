### What is Vim? 

Vim is a text editor for Unix that comes with Linux, BSD, and macOS. It is known to be fast and powerful, partly because it is a small program that can run in a terminal (although it has a graphical interface). It is mainly because it can be managed entirely without menus or a mouse with a keyboard.

### Why Vim?

In all POSIX systems, Vim is the default fallback editor. Vim is sure to be open, whether you have just installed the operating system, or you have booted into a minimal system repair environment, or you are unable to access any other editor. While you can switch out other tiny editors on your systems, such as GNU Nano or Jove, it's Vim that's all but guaranteed to be on every other system in the world.

## Global 

These are some of the common global Vim movements and commands used for file management and navigation. You can use these commands in normal mode by pressing `:` to enter command mode and then typing the desired command.

## Cursor 

To use these commands, you typically press the key combination in `Normal` mode. For example, to move the cursor down, you would press the `j` key, and to jump to the end of a word, you would press the `e` key.

You can also use a count before some commands to repeat them. For example, `3j` would move the cursor down three lines.

>Remember that Vim has different modes (Normal, Insert, Visual, etc.), and cursor movement commands are primarily used in Normal mode. If you're in a different mode (e.g., Insert), you may need to press Esc to return to Normal mode before using cursor movement commands.
