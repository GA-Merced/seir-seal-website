# Deployment Concepts for Web Applications

When deploying a web application, several essential concepts must be understood to ensure a smooth and secure deployment process. This section will introduce you to the fundamental concepts involved in deploying a web application.

## 1. Virtual Machine (VM) Instance and Static IP

A critical aspect of deploying a web application is selecting and configuring the infrastructure on which it will run. Typically, web applications are hosted on virtual machines (VMs) provided by cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Here's why:

- **Isolation**: VMs provide a level of isolation for your application, ensuring that it operates independently of other applications and environments.

- **Scalability**: VMs can be easily scaled up or down based on your application's traffic demands, making them suitable for handling varying workloads.

- **Static IP**: Assigning a static IP address to your VM is crucial because it provides a stable and permanent address for users to access your web application. This is essential for maintaining consistent access to your application, even if the VM is restarted or replaced.

## 2. Setting up a Firewall

Security is paramount when deploying web applications. Setting up a firewall is a fundamental step to protect your VM and application from unauthorized access and potential threats. Firewalls are used to:

- **Control Incoming and Outgoing Traffic**: Firewalls allow you to define rules for allowing or denying incoming and outgoing network traffic. This helps in restricting access to specific ports and services, enhancing security.

- **Protect Against Attacks**: Firewalls can help protect your web application from various types of attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

- **Traffic Filtering**: Firewalls can filter traffic based on source IP addresses, ports, or protocols, providing an additional layer of control and security.

## 3. Configuring Ports 80 and 443

Web applications typically communicate over specific ports on the internet. Ports 80 and 443 are commonly used for web traffic, and they serve different purposes:

- **Port 80 (HTTP)**: Port 80 is used for unencrypted HTTP traffic. It's essential for serving standard web content to users. However, it lacks encryption, making it less secure for transmitting sensitive data.

- **Port 443 (HTTPS)**: Port 443 is used for secure HTTP traffic, encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. It's the recommended choice for handling sensitive information, such as login credentials and payment details. Configuring your application to use HTTPS (port 443) is crucial for data security.

## 4. Using NGINX or Apache as Web Servers

NGINX and Apache are popular web server software options used to serve web applications. They serve several purposes in the deployment process:

- **HTTP Request Handling**: NGINX and Apache are responsible for receiving incoming HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and routing them to the appropriate components of your web application.

- **Load Balancing**: These web servers can distribute incoming traffic across multiple VM instances if you need to scale horizontally for increased performance and availability.

- **SSL/TLS Termination**: NGINX and Apache can handle SSL/TLS termination, decrypting incoming secure traffic (HTTPS) and forwarding it to your application servers as unencrypted HTTP traffic, or re-encrypting it for internal communication.

In summary, deploying a web application involves setting up infrastructure with VM instances and static IPs, securing your environment with firewalls, configuring ports 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, and utilizing web server software like NGINX or Apache to manage incoming requests and ensure optimal performance.

# Deployment Steps with Apache

## 1. Establishing an SSH Connection to Your Cloud VM

Assuming you have the SSH credentials for your cloud VM, you can establish a secure connection to it using a terminal. Here are the steps:

1. Open your terminal application.

2. Use the `ssh` command with your VM's IP address or hostname, and provide your SSH key if required:
   
```shell
   ssh username@your-vm-ip
```

Replace username with your VM's username and your-vm-ip with your VM's IP address.

You'll be prompted to enter your SSH key passphrase or password. Once authenticated, you'll have access to your VM's command line interface.

## 2. Setting Up the Firewall
To enhance security, it's essential to configure the firewall to allow external traffic only on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). Here's how:

Ensure you have administrative privileges on your VM.

Install a firewall management tool if it's not already installed. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ufw
```

Allow incoming traffic on ports 80 and 443:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

Enable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Verify that only the necessary ports are allowed:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

You should see that only ports 80 and 443 are open.

## 3. Installing and Setting Up Apache
Apache is a popular web server that can serve your web application. To install and set it up:

Update the package repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install Apache:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

Start the Apache service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

Enable Apache to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

### 4. Clone Your Node.js Application from GitHub
Assuming you have a Node.js application hosted on GitHub, you can clone it onto your VM:

Navigate to the directory where you want to store your application:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/app
```

Clone your GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-app.git
```

Install any application dependencies using npm or yarn.

### 5. Running Your Node.js Application on a Different Port

By default, Node.js applications often run on port 3000. To run your application on a different port, you can specify it when starting your application:

```bash
node app.js --port 8080
```

### 6. Redirecting Traffic Using Apache
Now that Apache is installed, you can configure it to redirect incoming HTTP traffic to your Node.js application running on a different port. Create an Apache Virtual Host configuration file for your application:

Create a new Apache configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your-app.conf
```

Add the following configuration, updating your-domain.com and ProxyPass accordingly:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the site and reload Apache to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo a2ensite your-app.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### 7. Setting Up SSL and Updating Apache
For secure HTTPS traffic, you'll need to set up SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and update your Apache configuration:

Install the Certbot tool to obtain and configure SSL certificates:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache
```

Follow the prompts to configure SSL for your domain.

Update your Apache Virtual Host configuration to include SSL:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your-app.conf
```

Add the following lines:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName your-domain.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
</VirtualHost>
```

Reload Apache to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Now, your web application is accessible over HTTPS, and Apache is properly configured to handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

# Deployment Steps with NGINX

## 1. Establishing an SSH Connection to Your Cloud VM

Assuming you have the SSH credentials for your cloud VM, you can establish a secure connection to it using a terminal. Follow these steps, as mentioned earlier in the Apache guide.

## 2. Setting Up the Firewall

Enhancing security is crucial, and configuring the firewall to allow external traffic only on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) is essential. The steps are similar to those mentioned in the Apache guide.

## 3. Installing and Setting Up NGINX

NGINX is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy that can serve your web application. Here's how to install and set it up:

Update the package repository:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
```

Install NGINX:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Start the NGINX service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

Enable NGINX to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### 4. Clone Your Node.js Application from GitHub
As before, assuming you have a Node.js application hosted on GitHub, you can clone it onto your VM following the same steps.

### 5. Running Your Node.js Application on a Different Port
Just as with Apache, you can run your Node.js application on a different port:

```bash
node app.js --port 8080
```

### 6. Configuring NGINX to Proxy Requests to Your Node.js Application
NGINX can be configured to act as a reverse proxy for your Node.js application. Create an NGINX configuration file for your application:

Create a new NGINX configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-app
```

Add the following configuration, updating your-domain.com and proxy_pass accordingly:

```js
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Create a symbolic link to enable the site configuration:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Test the NGINX configuration for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If there are no errors, reload NGINX to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 7. Setting Up SSL and Updating NGINX
To secure your web application with SSL, you can use Let's Encrypt with NGINX:

Install Certbot for NGINX:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain and configure NGINX:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Follow the prompts to set up SSL for your domain.

Test the NGINX configuration again:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If there are no errors, reload NGINX to apply the SSL configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now, your web application is accessible over HTTPS through NGINX, and you have set up SSL for secure communication.

These steps should help you deploy your web application using NGINX as the web server, with SSL encryption and proper firewall rules. Adapt the instructions to your specific setup and requirements.
