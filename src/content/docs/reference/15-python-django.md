## Basics of Python:
### 1. What Is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and more. It emphasizes code readability and a clean, concise syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

### 2. Defining Variables:
In Python, you can define variables to store and manipulate data. Variable names are case-sensitive and should follow certain naming conventions:

- Variable names can consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
- Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare a variable's data type explicitly. Python infers the data type based on the value assigned to it.

#### Examples of defining variables:

```py
# Integer variable
age = 25

# String variable
name = "Alice"

# Boolean variable
is_student = True

# Floating-point variable
price = 9.99
```
### 3. Data Types and Operators:
Python supports various data types and operators for performing operations on data. Here's an overview:

- a. **Numeric Data Types:**
  - **int:** Represents integer values, e.g., 10, -5.
  - **float:** Represents floating-point (decimal) values, e.g., 3.14, -0.5.
  - **complex:** Represents complex numbers, e.g., 1 + 2j.
- b. **String Data Type:**
  - **str:** Represents text or string values, enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes, e.g., 'Hello, World!'.
- c. **Boolean Data Type:**
  - **bool:** Represents Boolean values, either True or False.
- d. **Containers:**
  - **List:** An ordered collection of elements, denoted by square brackets [], e.g., [1, 2, 3].
  - **Tuple:** An ordered, immutable collection of elements, denoted by parentheses (), e.g., (1, 2, 3).
  - **Dictionary:** A collection of key-value pairs, denoted by curly braces {}, e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}.
  - **Set:** An unordered collection of unique elements, denoted by curly braces {}, e.g., {1, 2, 3}.
- e. **Operators:**
  - **Arithmetic Operators:** + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo), ** (exponentiation).

  - **Comparison Operators:** == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), >= (greater than or equal).

  - **Logical Operators:** and (logical AND), or (logical OR), not (logical NOT).

  - **Assignment Operators:** = (assignment), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply and assign), /= (divide and assign), %= (modulo and assign), **= (exponentiate and assign).

  - **Membership Operators:** in (checks if an element is present in a sequence), not in (checks if an element is not present).

  - **Identity Operators:** is (checks if two variables refer to the same object), is not (checks if two variables do not refer to the same object).

These basics provide a foundation for writing Python code. As you explore Python further, you'll delve into more advanced concepts and libraries to build a wide range of applications.
