## Package.json

### What is package.json?
In Node.js, the package.json file is a manifest file that contains metadata about a Node.js application or package. It serves multiple purposes:

- **Dependency Management:** It lists all the dependencies (external packages) required by the application, including their versions.

- **Script Definitions:** It defines various scripts that can be run using npm commands, such as running tests, starting the application, or building assets.

- **Metadata:** It includes metadata about the application, such as its name, version, description, author, and license information.

- **Configuration:** It can store configuration settings for the project, which can be accessed programmatically.

## The Node.js process Object
In Node.js, the process object is a global object that provides information and control over the current Node.js process. It is an instance of the EventEmitter class, which means it can emit events and handle event listeners.

The process object exposes a wide range of properties and methods that allow you to interact with the Node.js runtime environment, access environment variables, manage command-line arguments, and more. Here, we'll focus on some of the key properties of the process object:

### 1. process.argv
The process.argv property is an array that contains the command-line arguments passed to the Node.js process. The first element (`process.argv[0]`) is the path to the Node.js executable, and the second element (`process.argv[1]`) is the path to the JavaScript file being executed. Any additional command-line arguments are stored in subsequent elements of the array.

Example:

```js
// If you run "node script.js arg1 arg2"
console.log(process.argv);
// Output: [ 'node', '/path/to/script.js', 'arg1', 'arg2' ]
```

### 2. process.env
The process.env property is an object that contains the environment variables for the current process. You can access these variables to retrieve information such as system settings, configuration values, and user-defined variables.

Example:

```js
// Access the value of the "NODE_ENV" environment variable
const nodeEnv = process.env.NODE_ENV;
console.log(`Node environment: ${nodeEnv}`);
```

### 3. process.pid
The process.pid property returns the process ID (PID) of the current Node.js process. This can be useful for various purposes, such as monitoring and managing processes.

Example:

```js
console.log(`Process ID: ${process.pid}`);
```

### 4. process.platform
The process.platform property returns a string indicating the platform on which Node.js is running, such as 'darwin' for macOS, 'win32' for Windows, or 'linux' for Linux.

Example:

```js
console.log(`Platform: ${process.platform}`);
5. process.cwd()
```

The `process.cwd()` method returns the current working directory of the Node.js process. This is the directory from which the Node.js application was launched.

Example:

```js
console.log(`Current working directory: ${process.cwd()}`);
```

### 6. process.exit()

The `process.exit(code)` method allows you to exit the Node.js process with a specified exit code. It's commonly used to terminate the application, and the exit code can be used to convey information about the termination status (0 for success, non-zero for error).

Example:

```js
// Exit with a custom exit code (e.g., 1 for an error)
process.exit(1);
```

These are just a few of the many properties and methods available on the process object in Node.js. It provides valuable information and control over the runtime environment, making it an essential tool for building and managing Node.js applications.

## Working with Files and Folders using Node.js fs Library
The Node.js fs (File System) module is a built-in module that provides a range of functions for interacting with the file system. It allows you to perform operations such as reading, writing, creating, deleting, and managing files and directories in both synchronous and asynchronous ways.

### Checking if a File Exists Synchronously
To check if a file exists synchronously, you can use the fs.existsSync(path) function. It returns true if the file exists at the specified path and false otherwise.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const filePath = 'example.txt';

if (fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
  console.log(`${filePath} exists.`);
} else {
  console.log(`${filePath} does not exist.`);
}
```

### Creating Files and Folders Synchronously
To create files and folders synchronously, you can use the fs.writeFileSync(file, data) method to create a new file with the specified data and the fs.mkdirSync(path) method to create a new directory.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a new file
fs.writeFileSync('newfile.txt', 'Hello, world!');

// Create a new directory
fs.mkdirSync('newfolder');
```
### Reading Files Synchronously
You can read files synchronously using the `fs.readFileSync(path, [options])` method. This method returns the content of the file as a buffer or string, depending on the specified encoding.

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const filePath = 'example.txt';

try {
  const data = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'); // Read file as a UTF-8 encoded string
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error reading ${filePath}: ${err.message}`);
}
```

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Functions
When choosing between synchronous and asynchronous functions in Node.js, consider the following:

**Synchronous Functions:** Synchronous functions block the execution of the program until the operation is complete. They are suitable for simple scripts or when you need to ensure that a particular operation is finished before moving on.

**Asynchronous Functions:** Asynchronous functions do not block the program's execution, making them suitable for non-blocking I/O operations. They are commonly used in web servers and applications that require high concurrency.

In general, it's recommended to use asynchronous functions for I/O operations in Node.js to avoid blocking the event loop and ensure good performance, especially in server-side applications. However, synchronous functions can be useful for simple scripts or when you need to perform sequential operations.

### Example: Reading and Writing a JSON File Synchronously

Here's an example that demonstrates reading data from a JSON file, modifying it, and writing it back to the file synchronously:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const filePath = 'data.json';

try {
  // Read JSON data from the file
  const jsonData = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);

  // Modify the data
  data.name = 'John Doe';
  data.age = 30;

  // Write the modified JSON data back to the file
  fs.writeFileSync(filePath, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2), 'utf8');
  
  console.log('Data written to the file successfully.');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err.message}`);
}
```

In this example, we read JSON data from a file, modify it, and then write the updated data back to the same file synchronously.

## Running Child Processes with Node.js child_process Module
The Node.js child_process module is a built-in module that provides a way to create and manage child processes. Child processes are separate instances of the Node.js runtime that can run independently, allowing you to execute external commands, run scripts, and perform other tasks concurrently with your main Node.js application.

The child_process module provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for interacting with child processes. Here, we'll cover some of the key functions and when to use them.

### Spawning a Child Process
You can spawn a new child process using the child_process.spawn() method. This method allows you to execute an external command or run a script in a separate process.

Example (asynchronous):

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

// Spawning a child process to run a command
const child = spawn('ls', ['-l', '/']);

// Handling the child process output
child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`Child process output:\n${data}`);
});

// Handling errors
child.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`);
});

// Handling the child process exit event
child.on('exit', (code, signal) => {
  if (code !== null) {
    console.log(`Child process exited with code ${code}`);
  } else if (signal !== null) {
    console.log(`Child process terminated by signal ${signal}`);
  }
});
```
### Executing a Command in a Shell
To run a command within a shell, you can use the child_process.exec() method. This method allows you to execute shell commands, including piping and shell-specific syntax.

Example (asynchronous):

```js
const { exec } = require('child_process');

// Executing a command in a shell
exec('ls -l | grep "file.txt"', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error occurred: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`Command output:\n${stdout}`);
});
```
Forking a Node.js Module as a Child Process
You can use the `child_process.fork()` method to fork a Node.js module as a child process. This is particularly useful when you want to create multiple instances of a Node.js script to perform tasks concurrently.

Example (asynchronous):

```js
const { fork } = require('child_process');

// Forking a Node.js module as a child process
const child = fork('child_script.js');

// Communicating with the child process
child.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log(`Received message from child process: ${message}`);
});

// Sending a message to the child process
child.send('Hello from the parent process!');
```

### When to Use Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Functions
When working with child processes, it's important to choose between synchronous and asynchronous functions based on your application's requirements:

**Asynchronous Functions:** Asynchronous functions like `spawn()`, `exec()`, and `fork()` are non-blocking and are suitable for running processes concurrently with your main application. They are ideal for tasks that may take some time to complete.

**Synchronous Functions:** Synchronous functions like `spawnSync()` and `execSync()` block the execution of your main application until the child process completes. Use them when you need the result of a child process immediately or for simple scripting tasks.

In general, prefer asynchronous functions for most use cases to ensure that your application remains responsive and can handle multiple concurrent tasks.

The Node.js child_process module provides powerful tools for running child processes, making it possible to parallelize tasks, execute external commands, and interact with other processes in a Node.js environment.

## Working with Paths using Node.js path Module
The Node.js path module is a built-in module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It helps you perform various operations related to paths, such as joining, parsing, resolving, and manipulating paths in a cross-platform manner. This is especially useful because different operating systems use different path conventions (e.g., backslashes in Windows, forward slashes in Unix-like systems).

Here, we'll explore some of the key functions of the path module and common use cases.

### Constructing Paths
`path.join([...paths])`
The `path.join()` method joins one or more path segments together using the platform-specific separator and resolves any relative paths. It's useful for constructing file and directory paths.

Example:

```js
const path = require('path');

const folder = 'my-folder';
const file = 'my-file.txt';

const filePath = path.join(folder, file);
console.log(filePath); // Outputs: my-folder/my-file.txt (on Unix-like systems)
```
### Parsing Paths
`path.parse(pathString)`
The `path.parse()` method parses a path string into an object with properties representing the various components of the path, including the directory, base file name, and file extension.

Example:

```js
const path = require('path');

const filePath = '/root/project/file.txt';
const parsedPath = path.parse(filePath);
console.log(parsedPath);
/* Outputs:
{
  root: '/',
  dir: '/root/project',
  base: 'file.txt',
  ext: '.txt',
  name: 'file'
}
*/
```
### Resolving Paths
`path.resolve([...paths])`
The `path.resolve()` method resolves an absolute path from left to right by joining path segments and navigating up directories if necessary. It returns an absolute path relative to the current working directory.

Example:

```js
const path = require('path');

const absolutePath = path.resolve('/root', 'project', 'file.txt');
console.log(absolutePath); // Outputs: /root/project/file.txt (on Unix-like systems)
```

### Normalizing Paths
`path.normalize(pathString)`
The `path.normalize()` method normalizes a path by resolving `'..'` and `'.'` segments to simplify it. This is useful for cleaning up and ensuring a consistent path format.

Example:

```js
const path = require('path');

const dirtyPath = '/root/project/../file.txt';
const cleanPath = path.normalize(dirtyPath);
console.log(cleanPath); // Outputs: /root/file.txt (on Unix-like systems)
```

### Common Use Cases
**File Operations:** Use the path module when working with file operations to ensure that file paths are correctly formatted and platform-independent.

**Building URLs:** When constructing URLs in a web application, the path.join() method can be helpful for constructing paths in a consistent manner.

**Navigating Directories:** When navigating directories or determining the location of files or resources, use path.resolve() to create reliable absolute paths.

**File Path Parsing:** When you need to extract information from file paths, such as the file name, directory, or extension, use path.parse() for convenient parsing.

**Path Normalization:** When dealing with user-generated paths or handling inputs from different sources, use path.normalize() to ensure that paths are in a consistent format.

The Node.js path module simplifies path-related operations and ensures cross-platform compatibility. It's an essential tool for managing file and directory paths in Node.js applications.


## Writing a Basic Node.js CLI App
### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Create a new directory for your CLI app and navigate to it in your terminal.

Initialize a Node.js project by running:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command generates a package.json file with default values.

### Step 2: Create Your CLI Script
Create a JavaScript file for your CLI app. For example, you can name it cli.js.

Write your CLI app logic in this file. Here's a simple example that prints a welcome message and takes a user's name as an argument:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

const [, , ...args] = process.argv; // Get command-line arguments

const name = args.join(' ') || 'World';

console.log(`Hello, ${name}! This is your CLI app.`);
```

The `#!/usr/bin/env` node line is called a "shebang" and tells the system to use Node.js to run the script.

We use process.argv to get the command-line arguments passed to the script.

### Step 3: Make Your Script Executable
In your terminal, run the following command to make your script executable:

```bash
chmod +x cli.js
```

### Step 4: Test Your CLI App
Test your CLI app by running it from the command line:

```bash
./cli.js
```

You should see the welcome message.

Test it with arguments:

```bash
./cli.js John
```

You should see a personalized greeting.

## Publishing Your CLI App to NPM
### Step 5: Prepare Your Package
Update your package.json file with the following information:

"bin" field: This specifies the name of the CLI command and the path to your CLI script. For example:

```json
"bin": {
  "my-cli": "./cli.js"
}
```

Here, "my-cli" will be the command users run to execute your CLI app.

"main" field: Ensure that the "main" field in your package.json points to your CLI script. For example:

```json
"main": "cli.js"
```

Ensure your package.json contains accurate metadata, including a unique name, description, version, and author information.

### Step 6: Login to Your NPM Account
If you haven't already, create an account on npmjs.com.

In your terminal, log in to your npm account using the following command:

```bash
npm login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your npm username, password, and email address.

### Step 7: Publish Your Package
In your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory.

Run the following command to publish your package to the npm registry:

```bash
npm publish
```

If this is your first time publishing a package, npm will prompt you to confirm your package's details.

### Step 8: Verify Your Published Package
Visit your package's npm page by going to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME`, replacing `YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME` with your package's name.

You should see your package listed on npm's website.

### Step 9: Install and Use Your CLI App
To install and use your CLI app globally, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME
```

Replace YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME with the name you specified in your package.json under "name".

Now, you can use your CLI app from any terminal window:

```bash
my-cli John
```

Congratulations! You've successfully written a basic Node.js CLI app and published it to the npm registry. Users can now install and use your CLI app globally on their systems.
